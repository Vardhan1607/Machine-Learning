# Linear,Ridge,Lasso Regression
Consider the attached dataset about advertising and sales. The attributes denote the investments on advertising in TV, radio etc and the target variable is the total sales. <br />
The aim is to predict the sales from the investments on advertising. <br />
1)Data has been randomly divided into the dataset into training (75%) and testing (25%) subsets <br />
2)Using Linear Regression,fitting a model to predict the sales from investments ufrom scratch. Compared the coefficients as found by the python library function
Computed the mean squared error on the testing set <br />
3)Using ridge regression with different values of lambda (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100) plot the coefficients against each other(from scratch), and also compared the test set mean squared errors <br />
4)Using the library function of "LASSO regression" to found out which of the 3 features is most important. <br />
