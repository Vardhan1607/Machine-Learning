#Machine-Learning
Consider the attached dataset about advertising and sales. The attributes denote the investments on advertising in TV, radio etc and the target variable is the total sales.
The aim is to predict the sales from the investments on advertising.
Data has been randomly divided into the dataset into training (75%) and testing (25%) subsets
Using Linear Regression,fitting a model to predict the sales from investments ufrom scratch. Compared the coefficients as found by the python library function
Computed the mean squared error on the testing set
Using ridge regression with different values of lambda (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100) plot the coefficients against each other(from scratch), and also compared the test set mean squared errors
Using the library function of "LASSO regression" to found out which of the 3 features is most important.
